I am effing tired of Lua, it is nearly brilliant yet it is like it REFUSES to be:

main problem..... by far:

the frikking array reference, starting from 1.... dumb, doesn't work with mod, over thought, stupid
the assumed globals, this why likes perl anymore, it is incredibly confusing deciding on the the scop of variables, you have remember when you go like this:

local x = 0
x = 1 --CORRECT!!
local x = 1 --SLOWER!!

this leaves globals all over the fucking place


less of a concern, the intention for verbosity to make lua "easy":

if <blah> then
	<some shit>
end

while <blah> do
	<some shit>
end

"do" and "then" are the SAME!!! what's the fucking point? we have TWO different one's of these "{" but ONE of these "}"
this is like pascal all over again! Anyway most of can handle this one!


I am going to write a Python macro, yes, Python, to sort this out!


I am tempted to TRY and write a macro to convert to and from these paradigms, however I really wish that such a genius language was not dogged by such terrible oversights. Also, fuck javascript!

Firstly my priority would be the array reference! But this is the bloody worse one. How the hell am I going to ever achieve this, think about it.... omg!

Why does such a beautiful language have to be ruined by this! I mean what, include a new modulo function, what the fuck should we call it????
